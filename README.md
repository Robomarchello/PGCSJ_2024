This repository has the source code and the assets for the game that boopka and I made for Pygame community summer game jam.

### How to run it
You only need python and pygame-ce
You need to install both first
```shell script
python -m pip install pygame-ce==2.5.0
```
If you have git, you can close repository like this
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/Robomarchello/PGCSJ_2024.git
```
Once you did that, you'll be able to run the game as
```shell script
python main.py
```

### Features

- 30 levels
- saving progress
- 3 used mechanics and 3 that weren't used due to deadline :(
